# GSM
Send messages using M590E GSM Module. Using any infrared sensor you can send multiple messages on output changes. If you have the boot loop problem when SIM card is present in module you have to add a 470-1000 uF capacitor. This happens because you are not providing enough power to the module. Read the data sheet.
